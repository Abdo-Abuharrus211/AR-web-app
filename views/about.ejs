                        <p>
                            Project AudioReaper, now just <em>'AudioReaper'</em> started life as a simple Python script.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One evening, I was out with friends talking about our music collections, how extensive
                            our local libraries have become, and how it'd be nice to 'sync' them with our Spotify
                            accounts as that's now the most common way
                            people listen to music, even on PC.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Initially, AudioReaper simply read MP3 metadata and searched for matching tracks on Spotify,
                            but I quickly noticed that most MP3 files had incorrect or missing data tags. <br>
                            To fix this, I resorted to how I (a totally real person) identify a track, by reading the
                            file name! <br> Thanks to Natural
                            Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) I was able to implement a feature
                            to extract the data from the file names when tags were insufficient.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So in November of 2023, I started working on the program as a project for personal use and
                            self-development, and to share it with friends. <br>
                            Several months later, a friend suggested turning it into a Web app as others might like
                            something like this.
                        </p>
                        <p>So I embarked on developing this Web app slowly as I had other obligations that demanded most
                            of my energy, and this project's scope grew immensely afterward.</p>
                        <p>Finally, AudioReaper is deployed.
                            <br>It's not perfect but it's certainly <b>Done!</b>
                        </p>
